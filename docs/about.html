			<h3>I am here to help strengthen your relationship with plants. I make buying plants easy by delivering healthy, ready-to-go plants to your door and setting you up with the tips and tricks you need to help your plants thrive. Plants make life better. I make plants easy.</h3>
			<h4>Direct From the Greenhouse</h4>
			<p>When you buy a houseplant from a box store or nursery, it probably spends an average of four weeks traveling from a greenhouse to a drafty warehouse on a hot or cold truck. Then, it’s shipped to a store where it likely isn’t getting the water, light, or care it needs to thrive. With me, my plants are cared for by plant experts and kept in optimal conditions at our greenhouse where they’re shipped directly to you. So instead of your plant spending 4 weeks in an uncontrolled environment, it spends 3-4 days going from our greenhouse to your front door. This means your plants arrive healthy and already thriving.</p>
			<h4>Shipped to Your Door</h4>
			<p>My plants are shipped with care and experience. I've learned how to keep plants at the right temperature, protect their roots, and keep them healthy while they travel from our greenhouse to your home. My innovative packaging holds plants securely in place, preventing damage and decreasing soil spillage. Most shipments will arrive in under a week and all plants will be healthy, undamaged, and ready for you to enjoy.</p>
			<h4>All the Guidance</h4>
			<p>My expertise doesn’t stop once your plant leaves our greenhouse. I am here to help you with any and all of your plant care questions. From simple, customized care instructions included with your plant to real-time expert support, I want to make plant care easy. Feel free to email, text, or call me with any question you have — I am standing by and ready to help!</p>
